This is a tool for building custom fontawesome subsets based on categories. Currently it's designed to only work for business, marketing, and shopping categories but by adding more data it could work with additional sets. see `/categories/info.md` for more info on the data.

Modify `config.js` to adjust the parameters of the extraction.
